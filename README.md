# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help a fictional character to determine certain characteristics of employees at the large corporation called Pewlett Hackard. We were tasked with determining which employees were eligible for retirement based on their employee number, title, and birth and hire date data. Practically speaking we practiced SQL to slice and segment a large data set into a meaningful subset that could be used to help a corporation plan for a retirement wave and set them up to determine who might be good candidates for a mentorship program.

## Results
